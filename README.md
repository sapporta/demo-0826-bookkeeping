# bookkeeping

Uses [Sapporta](https://github.com/jasim/sapporta). TypeScript database
application with a Hono API, SQLite database, and React frontend.

## Run locally

Requires pnpm 11 or later; this project keeps its workspace settings in
`pnpm-workspace.yaml`, which earlier pnpm versions ignore.

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

`pnpm dev` prints this project's App and API URLs when it starts. Open the App
URL, `http://localhost:5391`, in a browser.

## Commands

- `pnpm dev` - start backend and frontend in watch mode
- `pnpm seed` - fill the development database with sample data from `packages/api/seed.ts`
- `pnpm typecheck` - typecheck the shared package, API, and frontend
- `pnpm --filter ./packages/api test` - run the ledger and report unit tests
- `pnpm build` - typecheck the workspace, then compile the shared package, API, and frontend
- `pnpm start` - run the production server after `pnpm build`
- `pnpm exec sapporta endpoints list` - inspect the running API

## Project layout

```
sapporta.json       project marker used by the Sapporta CLI
data/               application SQLite database
packages/api/       backend entry point, schema, migrations, and app routes
packages/api/seed.ts  sample data for development, run with `pnpm seed`
packages/api/script-runtime.ts  opens the app for a command-line script, with no server
packages/frontend/  React app, routes, styles, and browser API clients
packages/shared/    API contracts and types shared by backend and frontend
```

## Environment

- `.env.development` is for local development and is ignored by git.
- `.env.production.example` lists the production variables to set in your
  deployment environment.
- Email verification is required by default when `NODE_ENV=production` and is
  not required otherwise. Set `SAPPORTA_REQUIRE_VERIFIED_EMAIL=true` or `false`
  to override that default.
- `SAPPORTA_API_PORT` controls the API server port. Managed hosts may provide
  the conventional `PORT` variable instead. If both are set, they must match.
- `SAPPORTA_FRONTEND_PORT` controls the Vite frontend server port.
- `SAPPORTA_PUBLIC_APP_URL` is the origin a browser loads this app from. It is
  used for sign-in and for links in outgoing email. In development the browser
  loads the app from Vite, so it carries `SAPPORTA_FRONTEND_PORT`; a deployment
  sets it to its own domain, which has no relation to either port above.
- `SAPPORTA_MAIL_TRANSPORT=stream` prints development emails to the API console.
- `SAPPORTA_DEMO_USER_EMAIL` serves every request that carries no session
  cookie or bearer token as the account holding that address, so this demo
  opens straight into the books with nothing to sign in to. It is set to
  `test@example.com`, the sample-data account `pnpm seed` creates. Remove the
  line to require sign-in; a deployment holding real data never sets it.

## Running beside other Sapporta projects

`sapporta init` picked this project's ports above at random, so several projects
run side by side without being reconfigured. When a port is taken anyway,
`pnpm dev` names the setting to change: it checks the frontend port before
starting anything, and the API reports its own port as it boots. Pick a free
port, set it here, and change `SAPPORTA_PUBLIC_APP_URL` too if the frontend
port moved.

`pnpm exec sapporta` reads `SAPPORTA_API_PORT` from this file, so API-backed
commands reach this project's server without further configuration. Pass
`--api-url`, or set `SAPPORTA_API_URL`, only to talk to some other deployment.

## Deployment

See [`DEPLOYMENT.md`](./DEPLOYMENT.md).
